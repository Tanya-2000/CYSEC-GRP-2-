#EXPLAIN THE MEANING OF XAMPP AND BRIEFLY EXPLAIN 
MEANING OF LAMP STACK...
The full form of XAMPP stands for Cross-platform, Apache,
 MariaDB(Mysql), PHP and Perl. It is one of the simplest
 and light-weight local servers that is used to test your 
website locally. It is an open source platform. This includes 
X-OS because it works in all major operating systems like
 Windows, Linux, Mac etc.
LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python) is a very 
common example of a web service stack, named as an 
acronym of the names of its original four open-source 
components: the Linux operating system, the Apache 
HTTP Server, the MySQL relational database management 
system (RDBMS), and the PHP programming language. 
The LAMP components are largely interchangeable and 
not limited to the original selection. As a solution stack,
 LAMP is suitable for building dynamic web sites and web 
applications.

Since its creation, the LAMP model has been adapted
 to other componentry, though typically consisting of free
 and open-source software. For example, an equivalent
 installation on the Microsoft Windows family of operating
 systems is known as WAMP and an equivalent installation
 on macOS is known as MAMP.
